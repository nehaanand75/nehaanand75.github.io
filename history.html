<h1>The start of webservers</h1>
<p1>The origins of web servers can be traced back to the early 1990s. The very first web server, CERN httpd, was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. It ran on a NeXT computer and hosted the worldâ€™s first website, info.cern.ch, effectively marking the birth of the World Wide Web. A few years later, in 1993, the NCSA HTTPd server was developed at the University of Illinois. This server introduced the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), which allowed for the generation of dynamic content and paved the way for interactive websites.

<p2>As the internet expanded, the demand for more powerful and scalable web servers grew. In 1995, the Apache HTTP Server was launched by the Apache Software Foundation. Thanks to its modular design and strong community support, Apache quickly became the dominant web server. It offered extensive customization and was widely used across different platforms.</p2>
<p3>Today, the web server ecosystem is highly diverse, with various options tailored to different needs. Apache continues to be a widely used solution, especially for dynamic websites and applications. However, newer servers like Nginx have gained significant traction. Known for its speed, scalability, and efficient handling of concurrent connections, Nginx functions both as a web server and a reverse proxy, making it well-suited for modern web applications.</p3>
