  <p>Performance is a crucial factor in the effectiveness of any web server. To monitor and maintain server health, administrators typically track key metrics such as latency, throughput (requests per second), CPU and memory usage, and uptime.<b></b></p>
  <p2>With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, securing web servers has become more important than ever. Essential security practices include using SSL/TLS encryption, applying regular software updates and patches, and enforcing strict access controls. Emerging technologies like HTTP/3 and advancements in Transport Layer Security (TLS) are not only enhancing data protection but also helping to reduce latency. Modern web servers are also incorporating built-in security features to defend against a growing range of cyber risks.<b></b></p2>
  <p3>Web servers are foundational to the operation of today's web applications. They process incoming HTTP requests, serve both static and dynamic content, and facilitate communication with databases and other backend services. The ongoing evolution of web server technology has made it possible to build applications that are more scalable, secure, and high-performing. As web technologies continue to progress, the role of web servers will remain central to delivering fast, reliable, and seamless digital experience</p3>
