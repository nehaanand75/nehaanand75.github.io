      <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
      <ul>
    <li>A web server is a computer that stores websites and sends them to people when they request them. When you type a website address into your browser, the browser asks the web server for the page. The server then sends back the website content so it appears on your screen. This whole process follows a set of rules called HTTP, which lets computers communicate clearly.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Web servers are responsible for storing and delivering website content such as HTML pages, images, and videos. They also play an important role in security by protecting websites from unauthorized access and cyberattacks. Many web servers use load balancing to spread traffic across multiple servers, which helps keep websites fast and reliable. In addition, web servers keep logs and monitoring data so administrators can track performance, user activity, and errors. Finally, they use caching to store frequently accessed content, which reduces load and speeds up response times for users.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Web servers are built to scale, meaning they can handle many users at the same time, which makes them ideal for busy or growing websites. They are also designed to be reliable, running continuously and recovering quickly from failures. Security is another key feature, as web servers help protect websites from threats like DDoS attacks and SQL injection. Finally, web servers are highly customizable, allowing settings and features to be adjusted to meet the needs of different applications and websites.</li>
